  <p><em>Wanna be game developer.</em></p>
  <p><em>Just a loser. Probably will go nowhere.</em></p>

  <p>
    I have started to learn programming when I was 7 years old, but got <em>really</em> into it when I was ~12-13.
    Now I am almost 20 and still as useless as my first day. Don't get me wrong, I know the basics, but nothing
    more than that. Someone with around a week of experience/courses should be able to do better than me.
    Even right now, as a major in CS, I still am kinda...useless. Can't get out of tutorial hell.
  </p>
  <p>
    But... I still want my dream game to be a reality. I don't want it to fade away. I'd rather die than have this game not come to be. I don't
    care if it becomes popular or successful or anything. I just want to make it.
